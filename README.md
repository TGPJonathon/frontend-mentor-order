## Overview

This one wasn't too bad. For some reason display: grid and place-content:center did not work. I ended up going with margin: auto, but the behavior was weird.

Overall, this one didn't take too much time. I implemented feedback I received in a previous challenge and started using min-height and min for responsive components.
